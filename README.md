# Semi-supervised-Neural-Network-based-Face-Mask-and-Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance-Networks
This is code repository for the paper "Semi-supervised, Neural Network-based Approaches to Face Mask and Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Networks"
# Requirements:
* Matlab
* Python 3.7
* Sklearn 
* Glob
* Image
* OS
* CV2
* PCA
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow

# Run the Code:
1. Run the Face Detector MTCNN. Code availalbe: https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/mtcnn-face-detection/tree/master
2. Run the Feature extractors python files Gabor, Sobel, Laplacian, DWT wavelet, Canny, RGB, Grayscaled. e.g. canny2.py
3. Run the matlab files for KOAD. e.g. Exp0_canny2.m along with Exp14_canny2.m
4. Run the PCA and Autoencoders python files for comparison.

Dataset is not provided due to privacy issues of people images used.
